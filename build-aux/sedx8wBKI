## ------ ##
## Usage. ##
## ------ ##

# Run './libtool --help' for help with using this script from the
# command line.


## ------------------------------- ##
## User overridable command paths. ##
## ------------------------------- ##

# After configure completes, it has a better idea of some of the
# shell tools we need than the defaults used by the functions shared
# with bootstrap, so set those here where they can still be over-
# ridden by the user, but otherwise take precedence.

## -------------------------- ##
## Source external libraries. ##
## -------------------------- ##

# Much of our low-level functionality needs to be sourced from external
# libraries, which are installed to $pkgauxdir.

# Set a version string for this script.

## Global variables. ##
## ----------------- ##

# Except for the global variables explicitly listed below, the following
# functions in the '^func_' namespace, and the '^require_' namespace
# variables initialised in the 'Resource management' section, sourcing
# this file will not pollute your global namespace with anything
# else. There's no portable way to scope variables in Bourne shell
# though, so actually running these functions will sometimes place
# results into a variable named after the function, and often use
# temporary variables in the '^_G_' namespace. If you are careful to
# avoid using those namespaces casually in your sourcing script, things
# should continue to work as you expect. And, of course, you can freely
# overwrite any of the functions or variables defined here before
# calling anything to customize them.

EXIT_FAILURE=1
EXIT_MISMATCH=63  # $? = 63 is used to indicate version mismatch to missing.
EXIT_SKIP=77	  # $? = 77 is used to indicate a skipped test to automake.

# Allow overriding, eg assuming that you follow the convention of
# putting '$debug_cmd' at the start of all your functions, you can get
# bash to show function call trace with:
#
#    debug_cmd='eval echo "${FUNCNAME[0]} $*" >&2' bash your-script-name
debug_cmd=${debug_cmd-":"}
exit_cmd=:

# By convention, finish your script with:

# something went wrong during execution without actually bailing out at
# the point of failure.

# The default options also support '--debug', which will turn on shell
# execution tracing (see the comment above debug_cmd below for another
# use), and '--verbose' and the func_verbose function to allow your script
# to display verbose messages only when your user has specified
# '--verbose'.

  -module           build a library that can dlopened
  -no-fast-install  disable the fast-install mode
  -no-install       link a not-installable executable
  -no-undefined     declare that a library does not refer to external symbols
  -o OUTPUT-FILE    create OUTPUT-FILE from the specified objects

  -XCClinker FLAG   pass link-specific FLAG to the compiler driver (CC)

All other options (arguments beginning with '-') are ignored.

Every other argument is treated as a filename.  Files ending in '.la' are
treated as uninstalled libtool libraries, other files are standard or library
object files.

If the OUTPUT-FILE ends in '.la', then a libtool library is created,
only library objects ('.lo' files) may be specified, and '-rpath' is
required, except when creating a convenience library.

If OUTPUT-FILE ends in '.a' or '.lib', then a standard library is created
using 'ar' and 'ranlib', or on Windows using 'lib'.

If OUTPUT-FILE ends in '.lo' or '.$objext', then a reloadable object file
is created, otherwise an executable program is created."
